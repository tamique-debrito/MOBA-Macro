A simulator whose purpose is to allow practicing the "macro" elements of MOBA games without needing to think about the player mechanics.

Currently it supports:
   - Waves/turrets
   - Simplified combat, simple items
   - Building up and traversing a game tree for planning/self-play
   - Playing/pausing the simulation
